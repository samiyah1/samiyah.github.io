               <h2> Educational status and why programming</h2>
             <p> Am a holder of part2 certified public accounting <br />
              and diploma holder of islamic Banking<br />
               why i chose programming?! well <br />
               everyone probably asks me that <br />
               i think programming is one of the things<br />
               i have passion in knowing because my Dream <br />
               is to make a financial application that <br />
               can grow the economy of my country <br />
               and make Kenya grow from 3rd world country <br />
               to a developed country.<br />
               i chose finance with programming because <br />
               for me i think  they go hand in hand<br />
               programming needs  the financial strategy on how you can <br />
                make a good programmer and who you target for any invention <br />
                you need to make.</p>
